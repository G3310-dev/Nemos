## What's Nemos? 

In Greek, Nemos (νέμος) refers to a "grove" or "pasture," typically an open space or meadow used for grazing livestock. The term reflects the concept of land or natural space that is shared or designated for specific purposes within a community, particularly in rural or agricultural settings.

Additionally, Nemos shares roots with the Greek concept of nomos (νόμος), meaning "law" or "custom." This connection highlights the importance of organised, shared spaces and the laws or customs governing them in ancient Greek culture.
